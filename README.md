# FLU
A small library of [FLTK](https://www.fltk.org/index.php) (Fast Light Toolkit) widgets by Jason Bryan.

Formerly hosted by the Ohio Supercomputer Center of Ohio State University, the pages are [no longer available](https://www.osc.edu/~jbryan/FLU), though an [archived copy](https://web.archive.org/web/20041204013048/http://www.osc.edu/~jbryan/FLU/) of the site still exists, accessible via the WayBack Machine.

This repository exists to provide access to FLU 2.14 without the need to go through the archives.
